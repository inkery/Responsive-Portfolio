    <p>This is Me !!! Hello everyone and anyone reading this, My name is Dakota Riely Alexander Rodgers and I was born and raised in Peterborough, Ontario. There were a few stops on the way to where I am now but im sure somehow someway we will get into that at a later date.</p>

    <p>My hobbies are this bootcamp, playing videos games with my friends, working as bad as that sounds, and going outdoors either on hikes or mountain biking with my best friend. I both enjoy being indoors on my computer and being outside enjoying nature which sometimes can kind of battle eachother for time.</p>
